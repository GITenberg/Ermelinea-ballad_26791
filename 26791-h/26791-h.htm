5</span>ERMELINE.</h2>
<p>With lance upraised so haughtily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Thunye rides from Alsey town;<br />
On land and main he was, I ween,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A daring knight of high renown.</p>
<p>Sir Thunye rides in good green wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He fain will chase the nimble hare;<br />
And there he meeteth the Dwarf&rsquo;s daughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All with her band of maidens fair.</p>
<p>Sir Thunye rides in good green wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To chase the nimble hart and hind;<br />
And there he meets the Dwarf&rsquo;s daughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the linden bough reclin&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>She rested &rsquo;neath the linden&rsquo;s shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gold harp in her hand was seen:<br />
&ldquo;O yonder I spy Sir Thunye ride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bring him to my feet, I ween.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now sit ye down, my maids so small,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sit you down my little foot boy;<br />
For I the Runic note will play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till field and meadow bloom with joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then struck she amain the Runic stroke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The harp began so sweet to ring,<br />
The wild bird on the twig that sat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgot its merry song to sing.</p>
<p>The wild bird on the bough that sat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgot its merry song to sing;<br />
The wild hart running in the shaw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgot forthwith to leap and spring.</p>
<p>Then bloomed the mead, the bough burst forth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As wildly rang that Runic strain;<br />
Sir Thunye fiercely spurred his steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But, ah! to &rsquo;scape he strove in vain.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>It was the knight Sir Thunye then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From his good courser bounded he;<br />
He went up to the Dwarf&rsquo;s daughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And took his seat beside her knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail to thee, Daughter of the Dwarf!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do thou become my wedded wife,<br />
And I&rsquo;ll respect and honor thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All, all the days I gain in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here sitt&rsquo;st thou, Daughter of the Dwarf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A rose amongst the lilies all;<br />
No man can see thee in this world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But thee his own he fain would call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now list to me, Sir Thunye the knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give up, I beg, this amorous play;<br />
I have already a bridegroom bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The King whom all the dwarfs obey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father sits within the hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He marshals there his elfin power;<br />
Next Monday morn my bridegroom bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall bear me to his elfin bower.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;My mother in the hill doth sit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And plays with gold that round is strewn;<br />
But I stole away from out the hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To play upon my harp a tune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O ere the Dwarf shall thee possess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his shall be a bliss so high,<br />
O I will lose my youthful life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And break my faulchion willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered straight the Dwarf&rsquo;s daughter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with a frown thus answered she:<br />
&ldquo;O thou may&rsquo;st gain a lovelier bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But ne&rsquo;er, Sir Knight, wilt thou gain me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now haste away, Sir Thunye the knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I rede thee for thy life take heed;<br />
My father and my bold bridegroom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I ween will both be here with speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was her mother, the Dwarf&rsquo;s Lady,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She peeped from out the mountain&rsquo;s side;<br />
And she was aware of Sir Thunye there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing beneath the linden wide.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Out came her mother, the Dwarf&rsquo;s Lady,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And anger shone upon her face:<br />
&ldquo;Now hear Wolfhilda, daughter mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But ill beseems thee such a place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;dst better sit within the hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sew the linen white as snow,<br />
Than come to strike the gold harp here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the verdant forest bough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King of the Dwarfs has wedded thee.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy free consent he sought and won;<br />
Yet thou hast dared Sir Thunye here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To chain with stroke of magic Rune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the daughter of the Dwarf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must weeping into the mountain flee;<br />
Devoid of sense Sir Thunye went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind her, nor could hear nor see.</p>
<p>But hear what did the wife of the Dwarf:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With silk so soft a stool she spread,<br />
And there he sat till crow of cock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As though he had been stark and dead.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>But hear what did the wife of the Dwarf:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The book of power forth she brought,<br />
Therewith she broke the Runic thrall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein the hero had been caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now have I freed thee from the Runes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They never more can thee oppress:<br />
This have I done for honor&rsquo;s sake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My daughter thee shall not possess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much more, Sir Knight, for thee I&rsquo;ll do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For sheer goodwill and affection pure;<br />
I will for thee a bonnier bride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than any elfin maid procure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not born in this wild hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Christian folk I am the child;<br />
An only sister I possess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she Dame Ermeline is stil&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She bears the crown in merry England,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The crown and queenly dignity;<br />
Her daughter dear has stolen been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For thus the tale was told to me.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;Her daughter dear has stolen been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She lieth now in strict durance;<br />
To blessed Kirk she may not go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And far, far less to merry dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ne&rsquo;er may out of the window look<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Except to watch her women stand;<br />
Nor play at tables with the King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless the Queen is close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except the King, so aged and grey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No earthly man she e&rsquo;er has seen;<br />
Each night her chamber door is locked,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she who locks it is the Queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Damsel&rsquo;s named proud Ermeline,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She sits in Upsal sorrowing sore;<br />
Whilst bolts of steel and iron bars<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make fast the Damsel&rsquo;s chamber door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King he has a sister&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Allevod is the name he bears;<br />
And he&rsquo;s to wed the lovely maid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as he the Kingdom heirs.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;But I will give thee saddle and horse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And golden spurs I will supply;<br />
Thou ne&rsquo;er shalt ride a path so wild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou shalt reach a hostelry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will garments give to thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With gold adorned at the seam;<br />
And I will give thee a ruddy shield,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherein the richest diamonds gleam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will give thee a silken band,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With roses &rsquo;tis embroider&rsquo;d all;<br />
Whilst thou dost bear that girdle fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No word thou say&rsquo;st shall vainly
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forth stepped the Daughter of the Dwarf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For, ah! she loved the knight so dear:<br />
&ldquo;And I will give thee a faulchion good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I will give thee a polished spear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou ne&rsquo;er shalt ride through wood so wide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou shalt surely find the way;<br />
And ne&rsquo;er, Sir Knight, engage in fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But victory thou shalt bear away.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&ldquo;Thou never, never shalt sail the sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But in safety thou shalt come to land;<br />
Thou never, never shalt wounded be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I ween, by any human hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the proud Dame Thorelile,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clear wine into the cup she pour&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;Now haste thee from the elfin hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere home arrive the elfin Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thunye rides in the good green wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His spear it gleams so wide, so wide;<br />
And soon he meets the Dwarf himself,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To his mountain home as the Dwarf would ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well met, well met, Sir Thunye the Knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy horse he speeds right gallantly;<br />
Say whither, whither dost thou ride?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On journey bound thou seemst to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Riding to woo, Sir Dwarf, I am,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Riding to wed a beauteous lady;<br />
To break a spear I do not fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For weal or woe alike I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;Ride on thy way, Sir Thunye the Knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nought else than peace thou shalt have from me;<br
/>
In Upsal town a swain there lives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will willingly break a lance with thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thunye rides in Sweden&rsquo;s land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Essay his fortune there would he;<br />
And there he found nine stalwart knights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stood armed beneath the forest tree.</p>
<p>Upon their heads their helms were placed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their good shields glittered before their
breasts;<br />
By their sides hung down their gilded swords,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their spears hung ready within the rests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo, ye Swedish champions nine!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, will ye fight for honour now?<br />
Or will ye fight for ruddy gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the ladies&rsquo; love for whom ye
glow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered Allevod, the King&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High rose the pride his heart within:<br />
&ldquo;Enough I have of honour and gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more of either need I win.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;There sits a maid in Upsal town,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That maid is named proud Ermeline;<br />
By lance we&rsquo;ll settle whose shall be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That lovely maiden, mine or thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first course that together they rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So furious were that knightly twain<br />
Asunder burst their shields of gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their broken spears flew o&rsquo;er the
plain.</p>
<p>But now the second course they ride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And again they meet with a crash like thunder;<br />
Sir Allevod fell from his gilded selle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His sturdy neck-bone burst asunder.</p>
<p>That vexed sore the Swedish knights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their leader&rsquo;s fall they fain would wrake;<br
/>
But fortune proved so stern and dour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The good knight&rsquo;s faulchion drove them
back.</p>
<p>It was then the Swedish knights<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their ruffled garb adjusted they;<br />
And unto the hall, the regal hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Swedish King they took their way.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;A Jutt is come to our land, Sir King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Armed and dight in elfin way;<br />
Of eight good knights the limbs he&rsquo;s broke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who strove with him in battle fray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of eight good knights the limbs he broke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Halt and lame they will aye remain;<br />
And upon the sod lies Allevod,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy sister&rsquo;s son by that Jotun
slain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answer made the ancient King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rending his hair so long and grey:<br />
&ldquo;With sable and mard I&rsquo;ll them reward<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who dare this cursed Jutt to slay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forth rode the Swedish courtiers then,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To slay the Jutt so sure they made;<br />
But soon from them the vaunt he drove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such heavy blows on their polls he laid.</p>
<p>No sable and mard was their reward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When they returned from the battle fray;<br />
They must doff, I ween, their armour sheen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And clothe them in the wadmal grey.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>That vexed the Swedish courtiers sore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in mournful guise they murmured out:<br />
&ldquo;In Sweden&rsquo;s land lives none can stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this wild and sturdy Jutt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Thunye he to Upsal rides,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Respect and honour attend his path;<br />
The Swedish knights they held their peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And were only glad to escape his wrath.</p>
<p>And he has broken the huge steel-bar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he the savage bears has slain;<br />
And out he has led the lovely maid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who long in dreary thrall had lain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now welcome be, Sir Thunye the Knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto this savage Swedish clime;<br />
I say to thee in verity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve sighed for thee a weary time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was but a little child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To me &rsquo;twas spaed that a knight should come<br
/>
From foreign land, should Allevod slay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to England&rsquo;s realm should bear me
home.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;I beg of thee, Sir Thunye the Knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou as a Knight by me wilt stand;<br />
There liveth none beneath the sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To whom I&rsquo;d sooner yield my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered amain Sir Thunye the Knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he bowed his knee to the Lady fair;<br />
&ldquo;With heart and hand by thee to stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the holy name of Christ I swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so he took the lovely maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With her store of gold so ruddy of hue;<br />
And to Denmark&rsquo;s land he her conveyed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a loving pair full soon they grew.</p>
<p>He has carried her to his castle hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a blooming flower there she shone;<br />
Rejoic&eacute;d all, both great and small,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In Alsey&rsquo;s ancient town that wone.</p>
<p>It was bold Sir Thunye the Knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His knightly faith so well kept he;<br />
The next, next Monday morn he held<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His bridal&rsquo;s high festivity.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&rsquo;Twas noised about in merry England<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s lost daughter was found at last;<br
/>
Rejoiced, I ween, the King and Queen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And away for ever their grief they cast.</p>
<p>The King a scroll to Sir Thunye sent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wishing him luck with his Ermeline;<br />
And begged he&rsquo;d come across the foam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he to him might the crown resign.</p>
<p>It was good Sir Thunye the Knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He spread on the yard his sails so wide;<br />
And they arrived in the far England<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In less, I&rsquo;m told, than two months&rsquo;
tide.</p>
<p>It was good Sir Thunye the Knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He steered his vessel towards the strand;<br />
And, lo! the ancient King and Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were walking on the yellow sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now welcome be Sir Thunye the Knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thrice welcome be to this foreign strand;<br />
Of England all the fair kingdom shall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be subject to thy knightly hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>So he the kingdom has resigned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he has crowned the knight of fame;<br />
And dales and downs and England&rsquo;s towns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus subject to the knight became.</p>
<p>Now has Sir Thunye all achieved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now to joy may his heart resign;<br />
He rules by day old England gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sleeps at night with his Ermeline.</p>
<p>A King more powerful there is none<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than he, the flower of chivalry;<br />
The knights, they say, of Sweden pray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He never more their guest may be.</p>

21</span>THE CUCKOO&rsquo;S SONG IN MERION.<br />
<i>From the Welsh of Lewis Morris</i>.</h2>
<p>Though it has been my fate to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of gallant countries many a one;<br />
Good ale, and those that drank it free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wine in streams that seemed to run;<br />
The best of beer, the best of cheer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Allotted are to Merion.</p>
<p>The swarthy ox will drag his chain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At man&rsquo;s commandment that is done;<br />
His furrow break through earth with pain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up hill and hillock toiling on;<br />
Yet with more skill draw hearts at will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The maids of county Merion.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Merry the life, it must be owned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the hills of Merion;<br />
Though chill and drear the prospect round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Delight and joy are not unknown;<br />
O who would e&rsquo;er expect to hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mid mountain bogs the cuckoo&rsquo;s
tone?</p>
<p>O who display a mien full fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A wonder each to look upon?<br />
And who in every household care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Defy compare below the sun?<br />
And who make mad each sprightly lad?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The maids of county Merion.</p>
<p>O fair the salmon in the flood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That over golden sands doth run;<br />
And fair the thrush in his abode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That spreads his wings in gladsome fun;<br />
More beauteous look, if truth be spoke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The maids of county Merion.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Dear to the little birdies wild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their freedom in the forest lone;<br />
Dear to the little sucking child<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The nurse&rsquo;s breast it hangs upon;<br />
Though long I wait, I ne&rsquo;er can state<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How dear to me is Merion.</p>
<p>Sweet in the house the Telyn&rsquo;s <a

&nbsp;&nbsp; In love and joy where kindred wone;<br />
While each in turn a stanza sings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No sordid themes e&rsquo;er touched upon;<br />
Full sweet in sound the hearth around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The maidens&rsquo; song of Merion.</p>
<p>And though my body here it be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Travelling the countries up and down;<br />
Tasting delights of land and sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; True pleasure seems my heart to shun;<br />
Alas! there&rsquo;s need home, home to speed&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My soul it is in Merion.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
